    "In this notebook, I more thoroughly clean and analyze the `edstats_series` file that was obtained from [The World Bank](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/education-statistics). There were no file keys to help identify what the column labels meant, so I will review the columns and make assumptions along the way. The goal of this project is to better develop my data cleaning skills and possibly some data visualizations."
