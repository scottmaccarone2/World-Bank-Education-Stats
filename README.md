# World-Bank-Education-Stats
Some financial &amp; education related data from The World Bank
The goal of this project is to practice some data cleaning,
analysis, and visualizations.

After opening and analyzing the data sets pulled off
[The World Bank](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/education-statistics), 
I analyzed two of the datasets. The `EdStats_Series` dataset turned out to be
more of a compendium of data set resources. For example, if one were
interested in data sets pertaining to "teacher", the `EdStats_Series` dataset
provided sources or links to other websites with the desired information.

I decided to put more effort into the `EdStats_Country` dataset, which
provided slightly different information, pertaining more towards each country's
economic position (measured in various ways, though not ranked).

Currently, I am stuck with what I am sure is a simple problem: for each region,
count the number of countries that fall into each of the five different income
groups. Once that is completed, I will create pie charts, stacked box plots, or
separate box plots, to better visualize if there is any relationship between
the regions and the income groups.
